1. New item ideas:
   A. Slow down all birds in playfield/level.
   B. Make all birds in playfield/level lose half of their life.

2. New birds ideas:
   A. Bonus bird carrying a cat. Rising from below screen. Hit on bird will make cat fall. Hit on cat will give points. Bonus in the meaning that level won't be lost if bird isn't killed.

3. In between levels we should display more stats to player, like level score, bonus score (gained through fast shooting), shots used, retries left etc.
